# FEEL Recipes (Canonical)

## Dub / Slow / Broken Baseline (No New Features)

**BPM:** 65–75 (60 ok)

**FEEL**
- Grid: `1/16`
- Timebase: `HALF` (or `NORM` if BPM ~75)
- Length: `2B–4B`

**SETTINGS (regen)**
- Swing: `55–65%`
- Ghost notes: `10–20%`
- Min notes: `6–8`
- Max notes: `10–12`
- Octaves: `2–4`
- Quantize: `ON`

**PATTERN**
- Rests are mandatory
- Accents are rare but meaningful

**TEXTURE**
- Drive: `OFF` (or very light)
- LoFi: `OFF` or Tape `10–20%`

**Why it works**
- HALF-time creates space without speeding the pattern.
- Swing + offbeat = groove.
- Rests create air and tension.
- Bass floats instead of talking.
